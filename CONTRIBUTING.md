# Contributions
I cannot accept outside pull requests from the community for licensing reasons. To release to Apple's App Store I have to manage Strongbox under a dual licence. The code here is under the GPL which Apple will not allow in the App Store. As mentioned above the code is provided here for transparency and openness, something I consider a prerequisite for a Password Manager. I need to maintain full ownership of the code so that I can licence to Apple separately, and also any outside/other licencing that might come along, commercial or otherwise. Accepting contributions (no matter how awesome) would involve the contributer signing their life and probably first born child away... There is probably a way to do this but I believe it will involve legally binding documents and other bureaucracies so to keep things simple I'm just going to manage the development myself.
